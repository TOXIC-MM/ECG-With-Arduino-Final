# ECG-With-Arduino-Final
A Simple App For Monitoring Your Heartbeat Using ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 And ECG Sensor AD8232
Part 1: 
What is an ECG?
An ECG (electrocardiogram) is a test that records the electrical activity of your heart, including the rate and rhythm. It's usually quick and painless.

An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is done to check the heartbeat. It shows how fast or how slow the heart is beating. ECG test results can help your care team diagnose:

1. Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
2. A previous heart attack.
3. The cause of chest pain. For example, it may show signs of blocked or narrowed heart arteries.
An ECG may also be performed to assess the effectiveness of a pacemaker and heart disease treatments.

How to DIY one with ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 and AD8232 Sensor:

First, wire up everything according to this table:

Part 3: Test your Project
1. Do a head-to-toe assessment on your patient for a better result. You can use this checklist that I tested on my friend: [Checklist.xlsx](https://github.com/TOXIC-MM/ECG-With-ESP-Final/blob/main/Checklist_v2.xlsx)

2. Connect electrodes to the chest and measure the data with [Better Serial Plotter App](https://github.com/nathandunk/BetterSerialPlotter/releases)
The First Graph is recorded when the patient is relaxed
The Second Graph was recorded when the patient was stressed
